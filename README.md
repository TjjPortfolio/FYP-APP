This is my final year project - Approach To Predicting Air Quality Using Machine Learning

Dataset collect from Kaggle :
air quality dataset :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india?sel
weather Delhi dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hiteshsoneji/historical-weather-data-for-indian-cities?select=delhi.csv

Models are using Random Forest,XGBoost,SVR,SARIMA and ARIMA model. The best model is Random Forest Regression model. So,using RF model to deploy a simple application to predict air quality index (AQI).
